There isn't an endpoint that allow us to do both text search and filtering. There are however two endpoints which expose this features individually, `GET /discover/movie` which supports filtering and `GET /search/movie` which is meant for text search. We can use either one of these as a starting point and implement the missing features in the client to get us where we want. We chose to use `GET /discover/movie` because it supports sorting and returns a list of movies by descending levels of popularity by default, whereas `GET /discover/movie` requires the `query` param to be defined which is problematic in the initial state.
